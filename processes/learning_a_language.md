My process to Learn a Language
==============================

To learn a language - rewrite a problem you've already solved in the new language
- You've solved the problem, so you can focus on the syntax and rules of the new language

`Problem-centred` learning rather than `subject-centred` learning (solve 'Hello world' rather than 'learn JS')
- What problems can you solve in order to learn (apply to real problems)
- How adults intuitively learn -> I have a problem, solving it will enable me to learn

Learn other languages this week too(!)
- To see how my process to learning language works

Plan - what learning I'm going to do - WHAT PROBLEMS AM I GOING TO SOLVE in XX days this week
- Then review

## How do you test your learning?

Test your fluency by building something again that you've already built in another language

## Reflective Practice

Portfolios are a tool to help train *reflective practice* - I'm shifting the focus to be on training this skill, rather than training writing a portfolio.
