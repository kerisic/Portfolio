# Get the Middle Character(s)

## Requirements

The program runs in a repl like IRB or in the browser console

It's fine to use Ruby or JavaScript.

Your job is to return the middle character of a word.
1. If the word's length is odd, return the middle character.
2. If the word's length is even, return the middle 2 characters.

## Acceptance Criteria
```
get_middle("test") # => "es"
get_middle("testing") # => "t"
get_middle("middle") # => "dd"
get_middle("A") # => "A"
get_middle("of") # => "of"
```

## Planning tests

1. return only character of a single char length string
2. return both chars of a 2 char length string

3. return middle letter of 3 char string
