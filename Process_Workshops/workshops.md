## My set up hints for Jasmine

1. Install Jasmine test runner
    - [Jasmine standalone install](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine#installation)
        - Download the standalone distribution for your desired release from the [releases](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/releases) page
        - Create a Jasmine directory in your project - mkdir my-project/jasmine
        - Move the dist to your project directory - `mv jasmine/dist/jasmine-standalone-#.#.#.zip my-project/jasmine` (or just drag it in)
        - Change directory - `cd my-project/jasmine`
        - Unzip the dist - `unzip jasmine-standalone-#.#.#.zip`

    - [Makers steps](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/thermostat/setting_up_jasmine.md#to-complete-this-challenge-you-will-need-to)

    - Create files in `spec` and then `src`
    - Use script tags to load them in `SpecRunner.html`
    - Open `SpecRunner.html`
