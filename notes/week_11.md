## What I've learnt

_Things I've learnt or improved, and links to examples._

- **Concrete things** (e.g. written a test or set up rspec)
  - Written an api in Python

- **Concepts** (e.g. TDD or user stories)
  - Flask, SQLAlchemy and related DSLs
  - Agile work breakdown and workflow boards
  - Team communication and work sharing 

- **Processes** (e.g. debugging or problem breakdown -> TDD)
  - [Problem breakdown process](https://github.com/mattTea/Portfolio/blob/master/processes/problem_breakdown.md) to support with modelling of MVC in a Python-Flask-React project

- **Behaviours** (or my mindset when approaching certain things)
  - Work and story splitting to ensure all members of the team are aware of and have the opportunity to work on all features in application
  - Regular mobbing to ensure all team members are aware of all concepts and features in the code
