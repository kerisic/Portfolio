# Week 6

_A weekly journal to keep track of the work I am doing towards each of the goals._

[Weekly outline](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/week_outlines.md/)

------

## Goals

- Break down projects into tasks and allocate them to pairs
- Build to a specification (rather than challenges)
- Run stand-ups and retrospectives
- Use a branch/PR/merge git workflow
- Give and receive meaningful code review

------

## What I've learnt

_Things I've learnt or improved, and links to examples._

- **Concrete things** (e.g. written a test or set up rspec)
  - [example]()
  - [example]()

- **Concepts** (e.g. TDD or user stories)
  - Git branching and merging
  - GitHub pull requests
  - Link to [Pink BnB project](https://github.com/mattTea/Portfolio/blob/master/projects/makersBnB.md)

- **Processes** (e.g. debugging or problem breakdown -> TDD)
  - [example]()

- **Behaviours** (or my mindset when approaching certain things)
  - This week and the group project really helped me focus on how to breakdown and split tasks, and improve my code organisation so that it isn't tightly coupled. What drove this was having multiple people working on the code base, and the constant risk of overlapping in certain files and creating merge conflicts.
