# WEEK 6

## DAY 1

### Week 6 summary goal

[Outline](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/week_outlines.md/#week-6)


### Primary goal

**By the end of the week all developers can build tested, easy-to-change software in a team using the following processes**

- Break down projects into tasks and allocate them to pairs
- Build to a specification (rather than challenges)
- Run stand-ups and retrospectives
- Use a branch/PR/merge git workflow
- Give and receive meaningful code review


**Can you, with only a specification to guide you, work as part of a team to build a web app?**

To guide your learning, aim to be able to answer "yes" to the questions below. Return to these questions each day to guide your learning.

- Can you use the XP values to guide your behaviour?

- Can you follow the full developer workflow? (Creating issues, branching, reviewing, squirrelling, merging.)

- Can you keep code quality and test coverage high whilst building new features?
