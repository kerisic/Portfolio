# WEEK 6

## DAY 1

### Week 6 summary goal

[Outline](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/week_outlines.md/#week-6)


### Primary goal

**By the end of the week all developers can build tested, easy-to-change software in a team using the following processes**

- Break down projects into tasks and allocate them to pairs
- Build to a specification (rather than challenges)
- Run stand-ups and retrospectives
- Use a branch/PR/merge git workflow
- Give and receive meaningful code review


**Can you, with only a specification to guide you, work as part of a team to build a web app?**

To guide your learning, aim to be able to answer "yes" to the questions below. Return to these questions each day to guide your learning.

- Can you use the XP values to guide your behaviour?

- Can you follow the full developer workflow? (Creating issues, branching, reviewing, squirrelling, merging.)

- Can you keep code quality and test coverage high whilst building new features?



## DAY 4

### Portfolio workshop

LEON C - What is compelling

Themostat TDD example -> talks about how what he is specifically sharing (commit history of project) demonstrates his process to meet the goal

Bowling example -> compelling because of its honesty - "not the best code", but felt the safety in knowing his tests would prevent error

Reflective rather than showcasing

I know what is is, why it is valuable, and why it's important to what I have done (example in TDD)

Observation: Feedback is short for TDD goal

Debug anything -> outlines his process

Debug - an actual example of a bug and the resolution

Compared debugging different languages -> framework can work across any technologies

Modelling -> secret diary - demonstrates he can model something that he has not written the code for

Overall structure is compelling -> start with "how do I need to evidence this to demonstrate I can do this"

Why diagramming is important -> gaining consensus and making decisions to progress

Joel -> good capturing of feedback -> would like to see what he improved based on feedback

------

**CREDIBLE** means it's been validated by someone

The **review** is a 20 minute programming test under observation from a technical person
