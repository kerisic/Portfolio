## WEEK 2

[Peer code review](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/goals/recipes/code_review_1.md)

Code reviews -> help learning through reading others' code
- Practice at identifying ways code can be improved
- Different goal when building real-world code (more about quality of code, than improving your skiills)

[Code review checklist](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/code_review_checklist.md)

- Probably start with tests
- Then README
- Look at code last

Limit code reviews to 15 mins for `airport_challenge` sized project/repo
