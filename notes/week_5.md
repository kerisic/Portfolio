# Week 5

_A weekly journal to keep track of the work I am doing towards each of the goals._

[Weekly outline](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/week_outlines.md/)

------

## Goals

- Test drive a simple front-end web app with Javascript
- Follow an effective process for learning a new language


1. Test drive a simple front-end web app with Javascript
    - [Bowling challenge](https://github.com/mattTea/bowling-challenge)
    - [Airport in JavaScript](https://github.com/mattTea/airport-js)
    - [Thermostat](https://github.com/mattTea/thermostatThurs/commits/master)

2. Follow an effective process for learning a new language
    - [Airport challenge](https://github.com/mattTea/airport-js) - a problem I'd previously solved in Ruby, I rewrote in JavaScript to learn about the language and understand it's syntax and patterns
    - Link to my learning a language [process](https://github.com/mattTea/Portfolio/blob/master/processes/learning_a_language.md)

------

## What I've learnt

_Things I've learnt or improved, and links to examples._

- **Concrete things** (e.g. written a test or set up rspec)
  - JavaScript language
  - Jasmine as a test framework, used in all examples listed above

- **Concepts** (e.g. TDD or user stories)
  - Not a new concept, but test-driving a much more logic-heavy application [Bowling challenge](https://github.com/mattTea/bowling-challenge)

- **Processes** (e.g. debugging or problem breakdown -> TDD)
  - [Learning a language](https://github.com/mattTea/Portfolio/blob/master/processes/learning_a_language.md)

- **Behaviours** (or my mindset when approaching certain things)
  - Being flexible in using a spike/play/model then TDD cycle when trying to understand possible features
