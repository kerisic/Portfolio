Evidence Plan
Can you explain how the information flows between the browser and your website?
Which HTTP requests are sent by the browser?
What are the HTTP responses from the server?
Did you test drive the whole thing?
Do you have feature tests?
Ask these questions of your code â€” the answers should all be yes:
Do the tests pass?
If you break the code, do the tests fail?
Is the code straightforward and easy to read? Does someone who isn't me think so?
Is the code well designed? (e.g. broken into multiple files, each with a single responsibility)
What does a coach think of it?
