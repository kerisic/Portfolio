## Project: Bowling Scorecard

#### Towards achieving these goals

- I write code that is easy to change


#### Action Plan

Link to challenge [repo](https://github.com/makersacademy/bowling-challenge)


#### Evidence

_Evidence plan and links to examples_

- Go through the review rubric in repo `docs/`
- Ask these questions of your code â€” the answers should all be yes:
  - Do the tests pass?
  - Does the linter pass?
  - If you break the code, do the tests fail?
  - Is the code straightforward and easy to read? Does someone who isn't me think so?
  - Is the code well designed? (e.g. broken into multiple objects, each with a single responsibility)

- Did you test drive the whole thing?
- What does a coach think of it?
