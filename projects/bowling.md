# Project: Bowling Scorecard

## Towards achieving these goals

- I write code that is easy to change

## Action Plan

## Evidence

_Evidence plan and links to examples_

- Go through the review rubric in `docs` [folder in repo](https://github.com/makersacademy/bowling-challenge/blob/master/docs/review.md)
- Ask these questions of your code â€” the answers should all be yes:
  - Do the tests pass?
  - Does the linter pass?
  - If you break the code, do the tests fail?
  - Is the code straightforward and easy to read? Does someone who isn't me think so?
  - Is the code well designed? (e.g. broken into multiple objects, each with a single responsibility)

- Did you test drive the whole thing?
- What does a coach think of it?

## Updates and comments

Project completed: [14th April 2019](https://github.com/mattTea/bowling-challenge)


**What I learnt more of...**

- I felt I improved to a point where I was really able to rely on my [TDD process](https://github.com/mattTea/Portfolio/blob/master/processes/tdd.md) in this project. At points where I wasn't sure how the full logic would be implemented I was able to use my [problem breakdown](https://github.com/mattTea/Portfolio/blob/master/processes/problem_breakdown.md) and modelling processes to support my test-driving to continue to make safe steps towards the solution.


**What I found difficult and want to work on more...**

- Repeating similar code blocks that look like prime candidates for DRYing out
  - Similar html blocks repeated in `index.html` with UI interface code similarly repeated in `index.js`
  - I will look to learn and improve my ability to modularise this type of code
