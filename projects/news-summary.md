# Project: name

## Towards achieving these goals

- I can learn anything by myself
- I write code that is easy to change

------

## Action Plan

Link to challenge [repo](https://github.com/makersacademy/news-summary-challenge)

------

## Evidence

_Evidence plan and links to examples_

Ask these questions of your code â€” the answers should all be yes:
- Do the tests pass?
- Does the linter pass?
- If you break the code, do the tests fail?
- Is the code straightforward and easy to read? Does someone who isn't me think so?
- Is the code well designed? (e.g. broken into multiple objects, each with a single responsibility)
- Did you test drive the whole thing?

## Updates and comments

Project ongoing, [link to repo here](https://github.com/mattTea/news-summary-challenge)

- Improved my understanding of test frameworks and assertion libraries through writing [my own test runner](https://github.com/mattTea/news-summary-challenge/blob/master/public/src/assert.js) for this project


**What I learnt more of...**

- Further learnt about single page app architecture and implementation
- More exposure to and practice of vanilla JavaScript
- Wrote a JavaScript test framework, and used JavaScript without frameworks or libraries


**What I found difficult and want to work on more...**

- Still want to learn more about SPAs and callbacks when requesting data from external APIs
