Action Plan

Feel free to amend this plan, evidence, goals etc as much as you like to cater to your own journey.

Evidence Plan
Ask these questions of your code â€” the answers should all be yes:
Do the tests pass?
Does the linter pass?
If you break the code, do the tests fail?
Is the code straightforward and easy to read? Does someone who isn't me think so?
Is the code well designed? (e.g. broken into multiple objects, each with a single responsibility)
Did you test drive the whole thing?
What does a coach think of it?
