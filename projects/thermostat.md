## Project: Thermostat

#### Towards achieving these goals

- I write code that is easy to change


#### Action Plan

Link to challenge [repo](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/tree/master/thermostat)


#### Evidence

Evidence plan and links to examples

- I'm going to complete 50% of the challenges (empirical)
- I'm going to test-drive my code (empirical)
- I'm going to ask myself how I feel about the goals (emotional)
- I'm going to attempt the weekend challenge (empirical) and complete it, and get a review from a coach (credible)
