# Project: Thermostat

## Towards achieving these goals

## Evidence

Evidence plan and links to examples

- Fully test-driven code
- Learning and implementing a solution in a new language, also including...
  - Dynamic visual interface with JQuery
  - New testing framework (Jasmine)
  - Fetching data from external API

## Updates and comments

Project completed: [5th April 2019](https://github.com/mattTea/thermostatThurs)

Process, comments and new things...
- Brand new language this week with all challenges
- Utilised a problem-centred approach to learning a language and new concepts

My approach to learning a new language, how I went about it with this challenge...
- Built up my process of [learning a language](https://github.com/mattTea/Portfolio/blob/master/processes/learning_a_language.md)

Solution was test driven using a "pass-a-test-write-a-test" ping-pong process (with one pair partner in particular)
- It should be noted that the commit history showing this process wouldn't be my normal approach, as it meant commiting failing tests for the partner to pass, but it helped us learn some good test-driving and pairing skills
