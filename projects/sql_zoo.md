# Project: Visit the SQL zoo

## Towards achieving these goals

- I can learn anything by myself
- (Possibly I can program fluently?)

------

## Action Plan

SQL Zoo is an interactive site that allows you to learn SQL commands by querying interesting databases, without having to set anything up locally
Link to SQL zoo [challenges](https://sqlzoo.net/)

- Work through the basic challenges to start with, completing stages 0, 1, 2 and 3

- Continue to the more complex queries (stages 4 and beyond) and possibly choose my own path and answer my own questions about Nobel Prize winners, movies, population geography and more (n.b. choosing to do your own thing makes SQL Zoo complain a bit)

- Share my examples and outcomes
