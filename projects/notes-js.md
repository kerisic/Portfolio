# Project: Pure JS notes app

## Towards achieving these goals

- I write code that is easy to change
- I can refactor anything

------

## Action Plan

Link to practical or challenge [repo](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/further_javascript/00_challenge_track.md)

------

## Evidence

Evidence plan and links to examples

- Building a JS single page app
- Refactoring from code that is highly coupled and brittle, to that which is loosely coupled, with fully isolated tests

- Do you have a clear idea of what you and your pair partner are doing? What their struggles are at the moment, what they're trying to achieve?
  - Wardah - helped and supported her to understand fully isolating tests

- Have you received and given real code review? Real code review means feedback that results in changes to code (new commits).
