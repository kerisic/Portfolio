# Project: Chitter

## Towards achieving these goals

- I have a methodical approach to solving problems
- I can model anything
- I can program fluently
- I can TDD anything

------

## Action Plan

Details [here](https://github.com/makersacademy/chitter-challenge)

- Build a twitter clone
- A Sinatra MVC web app with connected database
- Test-driven
- Travis CI configuration for automated build on pull request

------

## Evidence

- I'll plan and model the problem breakdown to ensure I understand the steps I need to take

- I'll test-drive all aspects of the solution, through capybara feature tests and rspec unit tests

- I'll follow a red/green/commit/refactor/commit cycle so my commit history tells the story of the solution development

- I'll also manually test features in the browser after each green test

- Tests and linter all pass

- Application is readable, broken into multiple objects, each with a single responsibility

## Updates and comments

Project completed: [1st April 2019](https://github.com/mattTea/chitter-challenge)

- My approach to breaking down this problem, and ensuring it is easy to change is outlined in this section of the [solution readme](https://github.com/mattTea/chitter-challenge#my-approach)

- The problem breakdown, outlining object and database models can be found [here](https://github.com/mattTea/rps-challenge/blob/master/problem/problem_breakdown.md)


**What I learnt more of...**

- Improving my [problem breakdown process](https://github.com/mattTea/Portfolio/blob/master/processes/problem_breakdown.md)
- Further practising [debugging](https://github.com/mattTea/Portfolio/blob/master/processes/debugging.md), particularly in applications wih databases
