# Project: Magneto Learning

## Towards achieving these goals

- I can learn anything by myself
- I grow collaboratively
- I use an agile product development process

------

## Action Plan

In a team, build a project of your choosing using all you have learnt at Makers

------

## Evidence

- Link to [demo presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1O3Qw11uWk-g_1mEG3QZBzduglTaBqY-MLAOqOxz4kBw/edit#slide=id.g585c21e6ad_8_160)
- Link to [deployed app](http://mag-neto.herokuapp.com/)

1. Testing
    - 90% coverage
    - Feature tests throughout and unit tests for custom methods
    - Every member of the team can describe why every test exists

2. Distribution of work
    - All team members own the code, can describe why any part of the app exists, and made regular commits
    - Every completed ticket in the [workflow board](https://github.com/mattTea/magnetism/projects/1) has a closed or merged pull request

3. Code quality
    - Commit [messages](https://github.com/mattTea/magnetism/commits/master) are clear and include...
      - A single line describing the changes
      - A description of the user problem it solves

    - All pull requests are peer reviewed

5. Documentation
    - README contains description, install and run instructions and instructions to run tests
    - Regular retros and learning sessions (usually post-mobbing) were conducted and [recorded](https://github.com/mattTea/magnetism/tree/master/problem)

6. Deployment
    - Merging any branch into master automatically runs automated tests and deploys into production (TravisCI)

## Updates and comments

Project completed: [24th May 2019](https://github.com/mattTea/magnetism)

All technologies were brand new to all team members

- Semantic-UI css framework
- Python backend api
- Flask http framework (for Python)
- Pytest testing framework (for Python)
- Splinter feature testing framework (for Python)

Process, relevant comments and new things...

- Integrating two codebases in two separate technologies was new to everybody

- Understanding the MVC pattern in a new technology (Python and Flask)

- Helped improve the whole team's agile development process, through...
  - Maintaining a Kanban workflow board of development items
  - Morning stand-up and evening retro to ensure everyone shared progress, commitments, blockers and improvements
  - Focusing on slicing of minimal functionality for every feature as well as the overall product, before iterating with improvements and richer features
