# Project: MakersBnB

## Towards achieving these goals

- I write code that is easy to change

## Action Plan

Link to challenge [repo](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/tree/master/makersbnb)

Laugh! People visiting the studio often comment on how much we laugh. Use it as a barometer of how comfortably we are expressing ourselves.

## Evidence

- _Do you know how you're supposed to improve as a developer this week?_
  - Team working
    - Provide regular feedback to each other
    - Mob to solve problems
    - Regular check-ins to see how people are doing, how things are progressing, any blockers
    - Regular switching of pair partners and areas of work, to share knowledge and learn about all areas of the application
    - Daily retros to see if we achieved what we wanted to, and we can improve - also regular re-prioritisation if necessary

- _Is everyone having fun throughout the week? Ask them!_
- _Do you have a clear idea of what everyone in your team is doing? What their struggles are at the moment, what they're trying to achieve?_
  - Celebrated the good bits (getting databases running through node, changing direction on technology) - lots of high-fives when things worked!
  - Keeping an eye out for each other when we were getting blocked - regular check-ins and reviews of how we were doing
  - Decision-making as a team (switch from JS back to Ruby)

- _Have you received and given code reviews?_
  - Code reviews at pull request before we merged
  - Decisions were often shared between tests and code was written
  - Additional commits were added to PRs where feedback resulted in a change
  - Pairing on everything meant that 2 people always had a good view on design decisions for every bit of code, and the short reviews at each merge (also small, no branches lived for more than a few hours) meant all 4 of us could learn about every aspect of the code

- _How are others finding building on the code you wrote? Can they understand it? Can they build upon it? Ask them!_
  - We all built easily on each others code, and where we changed things we shared that
  - It also taught us not to get too precious over our own code, but to be pragmatic

- _Are you happy with the code you're writing? Is it as good as code you'd produce alone? Better?_
  - Decisions felt more thorough as each of us had to explain each of our decisions

- _Have you invited a coach to your retros or stand-ups to give you feedback on your process?_
  - We conducted a cohort wide show & tell/retro for every team - we all shared what we loved, what we learnt and what we longed for

## Updates and comments

Project completed: [12th April 2019](https://github.com/mattTea/makersBnB)

Process, relevant comments and new things...
- This group project really helped me focus even more on how to breakdown and split tasks, and improve my code organisation so that it isn't tightly coupled. What drove this was having multiple people working on the code base, and the constant risk of overlapping in certain files and creating merge conflicts. [Link to commit history](https://github.com/mattTea/makersBnB/commits/master).

- Git branching and merging

- GitHub pull requests

- When we hit a problem or an unknown, the team were great at gathering, either in front of a whiteboard or around a laptop and mobbing to resolve the issue

- Decision making was focused and timely too
  - Initially we started the project aiming to build a full-stack JavaScript app, and after initialling making some good progress we came up against a certain point where our collective mental model of the MVC pattern wasn't mature enough to translate it to JS. We discussed and quickly decided to revert to a Ruby application
  This decision was made Tuesday afternoon, but even with "sunk costs" we were happy to change tack and move ahead with an alternative


**What I learnt more of...**

- Continuing to build my process of learning a new language
- Building something as a team...
  - Things to watch out for, to plan for, and ways to separate areas to work on in a code base


**What I found difficult and want to work on more...**

- The MVC pattern in different languages and contexts
