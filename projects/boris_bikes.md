## Project: Boris Bikes

#### Towards achieving these goals

- I grow collaboratively
- I can model anything
- I can TDD anything


#### Action Plan

Details [here](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/tree/master/boris_bikes)

#### Evidence

- I can answer yes to the following...
  - I can diagram and explain my TDD process to my peers and/or a coach
  - I have collected feedback from my peers about how I am as a pair partner that shows I am improving

```

------------------------------------------
Good prompting to switch driver navigator regularly to ensure we were both engaged.

Methodical debugging to read irb errors (when running manual feature tests) to investigate feature file code to see what was actually happening.

------------------------------------------
Really good that you approached it as if if was the first time you’d conducted the challenges, you didn’t let us cheat and look up your previous code, and made us research the methods, etc if we didn’t understand them.

You didn’t make me feel in any way inferior for not having reached the same point as you!
