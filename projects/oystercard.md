# Project: Oystercard

## Towards achieving these goals

- I grow collaboratively
- I write code that is easy to change
- I can TDD anything

------

## Action Plan

Details [here](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/tree/master/oystercard)

Work in pairs to build the Oystercard application.

------

## Evidence

Plan for gathering evidence:
- My documented and used TDD process, with feedback from a coach.
- Code review from a more senior developer at Makers (particularly about extracting classes).
- My documented approach to extracting classes.

------

## Updates and comments

Project completed: [15th March 2019](https://github.com/mattTea/oystercard)

Approach to extracting classes...


**What I learnt more of...**

- Improving my [TDD process]() including feature tests
  (show how this has changed from week_1 - possible commit links)

- Structuring my rspec tests to give right level of detail, description and context, providing much more concise and accurate documentation of my program

- Feature injection and doubling to isolate classes under test
  - Found this hard, but finally moved from [this](commit/link) to [this](commit/link)
  - I was also able to progress from testing state ([in early tests](commit/link)) to testing for behaviour in [later tests](commit/link)


**What I found difficult and want to work on more...**

- Really testing for behaviour over state
- Isolating classes and be confident in using doubles in my tests
