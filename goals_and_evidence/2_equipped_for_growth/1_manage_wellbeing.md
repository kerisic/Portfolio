# I'm equipped for long term growth

## I manage my own wellbeing

### Reflect: What does it mean to manage my own wellbeing?

Software engineering demands continuous learning, and requires engineers solve new problems every day. With this huge cognitive load is is essential that each of us are able to stop, reflect and actively manage our physical and mental wellbeing.

### Can you say this about yourself? 

Yes

### Reflect: How does each of the following examples evidence achieving this goal?

1. Regularly cycling keeps helps me relieve physical aches from sitting at a computer for long periods of time, but more importantly provides a great way for me to be present, clear my head and often see a clearer way through a problem
    - [Link to my activities](https://github.com/mattTea/Portfolio/blob/master/images/makers-cycling.png) for some of my time at Makers. This is less than my usual cycling, based on the time commitment needed to get the most out of the course, but sufficient to keep my physical and mental wellbeing at a good level.

2. I have taken advantage of mindfulness (meditation) sessions whilst at Makers, taking time almost every day to practice this. Similar to my cycling this allows me to refresh my thoughts and start the afternoon with much more mental energy.

3. I also practice yoga once per week at Makers, a double benefit in stretching tense muscles after sitting for long periods, and also improving my core strength, which improves my cycling!
