# I help my teams succeed

## I grow collaboratively

#### Reflect: What does it mean to grow collaboratively?




#### Plan: List evidence you aim to collect that would together show you have credibly achieved this goal




#### Can you say this about yourself? 

Yes / No


#### Reflect: How does each of the following examples of your best work show evidence of achieving this goal? (e.g. Diode projects, Github repos)




### What feedback have you had?

#### Sam Ixer (week 5)

Really appreciated how you approached our feedback discussion - asking what learning goals I was targeting in the pairing session, and then giving feedback on how I'd performed on exactly those, it really helped me think about what my learning goals were - thank you!



#### Sam week 2! 
- "Really liked that you initiated a conversation at the start of the session about what I had liked/disliked or wanted to change from previous pairing sessions"
- "Conversation prompted us to set goals about what we wanted to achieve from the pairing session, and these ensured we focused on `doubles` and `refactoring tests to use contexts` (and we were both able to actively talk about changing those goals as we worked through the challenge


#### Arthur Ashman - on CV feedback
Incredible!! Thank you so much. This will give me real direction for my next draft - I really appreciate it. :)


**Feedback from Lauren** (week 1 pairing)
_Really good that you approached it as if if was the first time you’d conducted the challenges, you didn’t let us cheat and look up your previous code, and made us research the methods, etc if we didn’t understand them_
_You didn’t make me feel in any way inferior for not having reached the same point as you!_

### Feedback from Tomé Jesus (week 3 web)
_Really liked the pace we worked at too and especially liked that we were putting in the effort to figure things out before looking at the walkthroughs - that definitely did a lot to galvanise what was learned.

#### Arthur week 4
- _Really appreciated your curiosity - when we didn't fully understand a concept you were very happy to break things and pull them apart to understand how they were working_
  - _Examples included capybara and rspec setup, and class methods_
