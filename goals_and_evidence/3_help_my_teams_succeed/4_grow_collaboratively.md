# I help my teams succeed

## I grow collaboratively

### Reflect: What does it mean to grow collaboratively?

Growing collaboratively is to learn with teammates, peers and colleagues. Pair programming is a cornerstone of practicing this skill, as each partner will have different skills and experiences and will be able to share these through solving a problem together (linking nicely with [problem-centred learning](https://github.com/mattTea/portfolio/blob/master/goals_and_evidence/2_equipped_for_growth/2_learn_anything.md#i-can-learn-anything-by-myself)).

Having strong collaboration between team members also engenders a strong sense of co-ownership of the application or product being developed, which extends into the team wanting to share knowledge, increase ability together, and ensure understanding of the tools and technologies used to build the product are shared by everyone in the team.

### Plan: List evidence you aim to collect that would together show you have credibly achieved this goal

1. Feedback from pair partners and team members
    - [Link to feedback](https://github.com/mattTea/Portfolio/blob/master/goals_and_evidence/3_help_my_teams_succeed/4_grow_collaboratively.md#what-feedback-have-you-had)

2. Examples in projects and challenges
    - [Link to examples](https://github.com/mattTea/Portfolio/blob/master/goals_and_evidence/3_help_my_teams_succeed/4_grow_collaboratively.md#reflect-how-does-each-of-the-following-examples-show-evidence-of-achieving-this-goal)

### Can you say this about yourself? 

Yes

### Reflect: How does each of the following examples evidence achieving this goal?

1. Within the Acebook engineering project we planned and conducted a number of collaborative learning activities that ensured we all owned the product, and...
    - Could all explain how any aspect of the application worked
    - Could all explain why any part of the application existed
    - Could all review any other member's pull requests
    - Had all made commits

    - To do this, we switched pairs after every 2-day sprint, ensuring that we had someone with knowledge of the feature area in a pair with someone who hadn't worked on it before. In this way we ensured that everyone rotated through working on all features areas.
    - We conducted a per sprint team learning exercise, used to mob around particularly new or unknown areas. These included
      - The [Rails MVC model](https://github.com/mattTea/acebook-plaicebook/blob/master/docs/MVC.JPG)
      - Polymorphic associations - to reuse models within other models
      - The `devise` authentication library

2. During weekday projects and challenges we have paired with all members of the cohort. By doing this from the start I was really able to see the value in this practice, with both pair partners _always_ gaining knowledge collaboratively. If one person had got further in a challenge previously, they were able to really cement their understanding by supporting and helping their partner understand the concept; and if the partner had not got as far, they were able to challenge and use the other person to teach them and coach them. Memorable examples of this for me were...
    - [Lauren Qurashi](https://github.com/mattTea/Portfolio/blob/master/goals_and_evidence/3_help_my_teams_succeed/4_grow_collaboratively.md#what-feedback-have-you-had) (Boris Bikes challenge week 1)
    - [Wardeh Tarar](https://github.com/mattTea/Portfolio/blob/master/goals_and_evidence/3_help_my_teams_succeed/4_grow_collaboratively.md#what-feedback-have-you-had) (Notes app challenge week 7)
    - [Sam Ixer](https://github.com/mattTea/Portfolio/blob/master/goals_and_evidence/3_help_my_teams_succeed/4_grow_collaboratively.md#what-feedback-have-you-had) (Thermostat challenge week 5)

### What feedback have you had?

#### Amy Jordan (Acebook engineering project)

- You brought both fun and productivity to the team, making sure we had our eyes on the task at hand but also giving us the opportunity to learn and explore individually. You always made sure your learnings were shared with the group, as well as making sure we shared ours prompted by pull requests and code reviews. You definitely motivated me individually when I was having a down day and I'm sure the others in our team would say the same.


#### Wardah Tarar (week 7 pair partner)

- You really helped me understand dependency injection.
- You successfully created doubles in our tests, ensuring they were fully isolated (within [notes app](https://github.com/mattTea/Portfolio/blob/master/projects/notes-js.md))


#### Sam Ixer (week 5 pair partner)

- Really appreciated how you approached our feedback discussion - asking what learning goals I was targeting in the pairing session, and then giving feedback on how I'd performed on exactly those, it really helped me think about what my learning goals were - thank you!


#### Sam Ixer (week 2 pair partner)

- Really liked that you initiated a conversation at the start of the pairing session about what I had liked/disliked or wanted to change from previous pairing sessions.
- Conversation prompted us to set goals about what we wanted to achieve from the pairing session, and these ensured we focused on `doubles` and `refactoring tests to use contexts` (and we were both able to actively talk about changing those goals as we worked through the challenge).


#### Arthur Ashman (CV feedback)

- Incredible!! Thank you so much. This will give me real direction for my next draft - I really appreciate it. :)


#### Lauren Qurashi (week 1 pair partner)

- Really good that you approached it as if if was the first time you’d conducted the challenges, you didn’t let us cheat and look up your previous code, and made us research the methods, etc if we didn’t understand them.


#### Tomé Jesus (week 3 pair partner)

- Really liked the pace we worked at too and especially liked that we were putting in the effort to figure things out before looking at any walkthroughs - that definitely did a lot to galvanise what was learned.


#### Arthur Ashman (week 4 pair partner)

- Really appreciated your curiosity - when we didn't fully understand a concept you were very happy to break things and pull them apart to understand how they were working (examples included Capybara and rspec setup, also class methods)
