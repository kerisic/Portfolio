# I help my teams succeed

## I grow collaboratively

#### Reflect: What does it mean to grow collaboratively?




#### Plan: List evidence you aim to collect that would together show you have credibly achieved this goal




#### Can you say this about yourself? 

Yes / No


#### Reflect: How does each of the following examples of your best work show evidence of achieving this goal? (e.g. Diode projects, Github repos)




### What feedback have you had?

#### Sam Ixer (week 5)

Really appreciated how you approached our feedback discussion - asking what learning goals I was targeting in the pairing session, and then giving feedback on how I'd performed on exactly those, it really helped me think about what my learning goals were - thank you!
