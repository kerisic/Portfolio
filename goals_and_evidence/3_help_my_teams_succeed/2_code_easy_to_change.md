## I write code that is easy to change

### Reflect: What does it mean to write code that is easy to change?

The option of rewriting a program is not possible in any enterprise environment, so ensuring the code is readable, and easy to change by any developer on the team is essential.

Code should be easily readable by someone coming to the program, without having had the benefit of test-driving, or being involved in the early design decisions. It should be loosely coupled so that changes in one part of the program don't affect others. Tests should isolate the class or object and methods under test so that any changes or errors in other parts of the code don't break tests for unrelated objects.

For code to be easy to change, it should...
- Have accurate and descriptive naming throughout 
- Have short, single responsibility functions or methods
- Meet linting conventions
- Be loosely coupled so classes or objects are not overly dependent on each other, and may be tested independently 

------

### Plan: List evidence you aim to collect that would together show you have credibly achieved this goal

1. I can answer **yes** to the following questions for a project
    - Do the tests pass?
    - Does the linter pass?
    - If you break the code, do the tests fail?
    - Is the code straightforward and easy to read?
    - Is the code well designed? (e.g. broken into multiple objects, each with a single responsibility)
    - Did you test drive the whole thing?

2. Evidence from a team project
    - Have you received and given code reviews?
    - How are others finding building on the code you wrote? Can they understand it? Can they build upon it?
    - Are you happy with the code you're writing? Is it as good as code you'd produce alone? Better?

3. Feedback from a team member, based on following questions
    - How did you find building on the code I wrote? 
    - Could you understand it?
    - Could you build upon it?

<!-- 4. Feedback from a coach for a completed challenge -->

### Can you say this about yourself? 

Yes

### Reflect: How does each of the following examples evidence achieving this goal?

1. I can answer **yes** to the following questions for the [Bowling Scorecard](https://github.com/mattTea/Portfolio/blob/master/projects/bowling.md) project
    - Do the tests pass?
    - Does the linter pass?
    - If you break the code, do the tests fail?
    <!-- - Is the code straightforward and easy to read? Feedback from [coach tbc](https://github.com/mattTea/Portfolio/blob/master/goals_and_evidence/3_help_my_teams_succeed/2_code_easy_to_change.md#what-feedback-have-you-had) -->
    - Is the code well designed? (e.g. broken into multiple objects, each with a single responsibility)
    - Did you test drive the whole thing?

2. Evidence from [Makers BnB](https://github.com/mattTea/Portfolio/blob/master/projects/makersBnB.md) project
    - _Have you received and given code reviews?_
      - Code reviews at pull request before we merged
      - Decisions were often shared between tests and code was written
      - Additional commits were added to PRs where feedback resulted in a change
      - Pairing on everything meant that 2 people always had a good view on design decisions for every bit of code, and the short reviews at each merge (also small, no branches lived for more than a few hours) meant all 4 of us could learn about every aspect of the code

    - _How are others finding building on the code you wrote? Can they understand it? Can they build upon it? Ask them!_
      - We all built easily on each others code, and where we changed things we shared that
      - It also taught us not to get too precious over our own code, but to be pragmatic

    - _Are you happy with the code you're writing? Is it as good as code you'd produce alone? Better?_
      - Decisions felt more thorough as each of us had to explain each of our decisions

3. Feedback from a team member, based on following questions
    - How did you find building on the code I wrote? 
    - Could you understand it?
    - Could you build upon it?

### What feedback have you had?

**Amy Jordan** (cohort peer and team member on makers BnB project)

We alternated pairs every day while completing this project. When coming to use or add to code that I had not written with Matt (or even during code review), I was quickly able to understand it and build upon it. This was made notably easier by clear commit messages, simple and clean methods/classes and following good OOP principles (eg, code is DRY and follows SRP).
