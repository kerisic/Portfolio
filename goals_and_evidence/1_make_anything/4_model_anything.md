# I can make anything

## I can model anything

### Reflect: What does it mean to be able to model anything?

As part of breaking a problem down, and in order to evaluate implementation options it is important to plan a program through modelling. Modelling helps communication in an engineering team, which helps in reviewing options, gaining consensus and making design decisions before any code has been written.

Being able to diagram anything is a vital skill, as it not only allows a developer to plan the interactions of a program they are yet to build, but it is also a key skill in being able to understand and communicate about programs that have been written by others.

### Plan: List evidence you aim to collect that would together show you have credibly achieved this goal

1. Modelling examples in projects and challenges
    - [Link to examples](https://github.com/mattTea/Portfolio/blob/master/goals_and_evidence/1_make_anything/4_model_anything.md#reflect-how-does-each-of-the-following-examples-show-evidence-of-achieving-this-goal)

2. Feedback from pair partners

### Can you say this about yourself? 

Yes

### Reflect: How does each of the following examples show evidence of achieving this goal?

<!-- Complete his section -->

1. Projects and challenges
    - Takeaway challenge had some good models

2. Include db modelling in here too
    - Chitter includes some CVCs

3. MVC model & Req/Res model
    - PlaiceBook team learning
    - Notes app?

### What feedback have you had?

#### Sam Ixer (week 5)

- Really like your questions on 'what would a user want to do' to keep the focus on how the features should work, and domain model thinking when test-driving - a real strength of yours.
