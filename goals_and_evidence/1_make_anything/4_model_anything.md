# I can make anything

## I can model anything

### Reflect: What does it mean to be able to model anything?

As part of breaking a problem down, and in order to evaluate implementation options it is important to plan a program through modelling. Modelling helps communication in an engineering team, which helps in reviewing options, gaining consensus and making design decisions before any code has been written.

Being able to diagram anything is a vital skill, as it not only allows a developer to plan the interactions of a program they are yet to build, but it is also a key skill in being able to understand and communicate details of programs that have been written by others.

### Plan: List evidence you aim to collect that would together show you have credibly achieved this goal

1. Modelling examples in projects and challenges

2. Feedback from pair partners

### Can you say this about yourself? 

Yes

### Reflect: How does each of the following examples show evidence of achieving this goal?

1. As part of the [Takeaway challenge](https://github.com/mattTea/Portfolio/blob/master/projects/takeaway.md), one of our earlier challenges, I produced a number of models to really help me break down and understand the problem, both before I started and iteratively, as more of the program took shape. This enabled me to plan my approach, and also to maintain my understanding of impacts on different parts of the program as it took shape and things inevitably changed.
    - [Object and feature modelling](https://github.com/mattTea/takeaway-challenge/blob/master/problem/user_stories.md) to breakdown requirements.
    - [Class diagram](https://github.com/mattTea/takeaway-challenge/blob/master/problem/takeaway_class_diagram.jpg) to plan and understand how the various components should interact.
    - [Sequence diagram](https://github.com/mattTea/takeaway-challenge/blob/master/problem/takeaway_sequence_diagram.jpg) to plan how and when parts of the application should delegate responsibility to other components.


2. The Chitter challenge was one of the first web apps I'd built with a database, so I made sure to model the database using Class Responsibility Collaborator cards (CRCs) and the table structure before beginning.

3. The [AceBook engineering project](https://github.com/mattTea/portfolio/blob/master/projects/plaicebook.md) required us to build a Rails web app. This was built by a team of 4 of us, none of whom had used the Rails framework before. The biggest challenge we found early on was that as we had not written much of the underlying model code (Rails provides much of this), we were uncertain of how all the components of the program interacted. We held a team learning session to discuss and diagram the MVC model in place for this app

### What feedback have you had?

#### Sam Ixer (week 5)

- Really like your questions on 'what would a user want to do' to keep the focus on how the features should work, and domain model thinking when test-driving - a real strength of yours.
