# I can make anything

## I can refactor anything

### Reflect: What does it mean to be able to refactor anything?

Refactoring is not about adding anything new to a program, in fact it absolutely should not add any new functionality. It is the process of making code more readable, easier to change, and ensuring the practices of DRY code, single responsibility and testing in isolation are implemented as much as is practical.

Refactoring is of benefit to members of the development team, users should see no change and all tests should continue to pass.

To be able to refactor anything means that it is possible to take any developer's code, understand the goals, the style and the design decisions made, and improve the code in all the above ways without forcing a particular style.
It is not about changing another developer's code to meet all your own style opinions, a developer should be pragmatic and understanding of other styles when refactoring

### Plan: List evidence you aim to collect that would together show you have credibly achieved this goal

Commit histories that show how I have refactored my own and others code, making code easy to read, and easy to change
- Refactored from [this commit](https://github.com/mattTea/notes-app-Tuesday/commit/f8ed791a81026b99c266d76260eccce314c0a747) to [this commit](https://github.com/mattTea/notes-app-Tuesday/commit/20b29a826707be723a6abb7c0d21dc1560780901) and [this commit](https://github.com/mattTea/notes-app-Tuesday/commit/af4b815564cbcdfd104ceb7ab2b7c853de4ab971) in Notes App
- [Link to Bowling Scorecard](https://github.com/mattTea/bowling-challenge/commits/master)
  - **tbc** show how I refactored some of the long functions (after 2nd weekend of challenge)

### Can you say this about yourself? 

Yes / No

### Reflect: How does each of the following examples of your best work show evidence of achieving this goal? (e.g. Diode projects, Github repos)

During the building of a JavaScript single page [Notes app]() I inherited code that my pair partner had produced and worked on with a previous pair. I was able to refactor many of the tests to fully isolate the objects under test. This refactoring can be seen starting where I inherited the code at [this commit](https://github.com/mattTea/notes-app-Tuesday/commit/f8ed791a81026b99c266d76260eccce314c0a747) through to [this refactored commit](https://github.com/mattTea/notes-app-Tuesday/commit/20b29a826707be723a6abb7c0d21dc1560780901) and [this refactored commit](https://github.com/mattTea/notes-app-Tuesday/commit/af4b815564cbcdfd104ceb7ab2b7c853de4ab971).

### What feedback have you had?

#### Wardah Tarar - cohort pair partner

- Helped me understand dependency injection, and you enabled us to successfully refactor our code to ensure our tests were fully isolated.
