# I can make anything

## I can TDD anything

### Reflect: What does it mean to be able to TDD anything?

The ability to take requirements (user stories) and the behavioural descriptions they provide to guide first the test I write, and then the code I write to pass that test.

Each test should be the simplest next step, and each piece of code written should be the simplest to pass that test and nothing more.


#### Process

_Overview_

- Break out the `objects` and `messages` from the user story, and create a table highlighting which messages you expect to be passed to which objects.
- Write a feature test for the user story (how you expect to interact with the class(es) and method(s) in the story) - this can be in a `repl`, or later in the development process, in an automated feature test file.
- Use the first feature test failure to guide the first unit test.
- Use the first unit test failure to guide the first (and absolute simplest) code implementation to pass both tests.
- Repeat.


_Detail_

My [process](https://github.com/mattTea/Portfolio/blob/master/processes/tdd.md) in detail, for test-driving anything.

### Plan: List evidence you aim to collect that would together show you have credibly achieved this goal

My process to test-drive any problem through to a code solution.

Screen recordings of me using this process.

Feedback from pair partners.

Feedback from process workshop partners.

Feedback from a coach.


_Things to consider:_
_- Are tests isolated?_
_- Are all tests meaningful?_
_- Are the test descriptions clear?_
_- Has a consistent TDD process been followed? How could you tell?)_

### Can you say this about yourself? 

Yes / No

### Reflect: How does each of the following examples of your best work show evidence of achieving this goal? (e.g. Diode projects, Github repos)

1. The process and approach I took during [project 'x']() shows an improvement over my process used in [project 'y'](), because...

2. In this [project]() I first test-drove an rspec feature file, which in turn test-drove my unit tests, which then drove my code. This was the first project I automated my feature tests as part of my TDD process. I believe this kept the focus even closer on the behaviour described in each user story when driving the class structure.

### What feedback have you had?

**Riya Dattani** cohort pair partner

  - _Found the breaking down of each user story and problem into an object model table and example feature test (in irb) of how the program would work really useful in planning how we would step through the problem._

  - _Great feature test check_ ([code review comment](https://github.com/makersacademy/airport_challenge/pull/1328#discussion_r264163812) regarding writing irb feature test plans)
