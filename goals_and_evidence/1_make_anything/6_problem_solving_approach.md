# I can make anything

## I have a methodical approach to solving problems

### Reflect: What does it mean to have a methodical approach to solving problems?

Software development and engineering is all about problem solving, so it is essential to be able to approach all kinds of problems with the same rigour and consistency. To ensure programs meet clean code principles such as single responsibility, being as DRY as possible and easy to change, breaking a problem down, planning the responsibilities of each component, and how they will interact should be the first step to solve any problem.

It is far simpler to change ideas and direction before writing any code, so it is also necessary to break down as much of the complete problem as possible before making decisions about architecture and technology.

Having a consistent and repeatable process to problem solving also gives me confidence as a developer to tackle any problem I'm faced with.

### Plan: List evidence you aim to collect that would together show you have credibly achieved this goal

1. My problem breakdown process
    - [Link to process](https://github.com/mattTea/Portfolio/blob/master/processes/problem_breakdown.md)

2. The above process in use
    - Link to [project examples](https://github.com/mattTea/portfolio/blob/master/goals_and_evidence/1_make_anything/6_problem_solving_approach.md#reflect-how-does-each-of-the-following-examples-show-evidence-of-achieving-this-goal)

3. Feedback from pair partners

### Can you say this about yourself? 

Yes

### Reflect: How does each of the following examples show evidence of achieving this goal?

1. Following my [process](https://github.com/mattTea/Portfolio/blob/master/processes/problem_breakdown.md) to breakdown the logic within the [Bowling Scorecard](https://github.com/mattTea/Portfolio/blob/master/projects/bowling.md) challenge
    - The problem was broken down using a number of different methods as outlined in the [README here](https://github.com/mattTea/bowling-challenge#problem-breakdown).
    - This allowed me to iteratively design the components of the program, enabling me to cheaply change things as my understanding grew and decisions were made. (Cheaply, because I was able to make these changes before writing any code).
    - This approach also helped guide my early, simple tests and hence the early development of features. 

2. [Takeaway]([Takeaway](https://github.com/mattTea/Portfolio/blob/master/projects/takeaway.md)) challenge
    - [Link to problem breakdown approach](https://github.com/mattTea/takeaway-challenge#my-approach)
    - This approach ensured I was able to quickly break down the problem enough to understand the likely program components I would need, by breaking down the user stories into [objects and methods](https://github.com/mattTea/takeaway-challenge/blob/master/problem/user_stories.md)
    - To increase my understanding of how the objects needed to interact I then developed a [class diagram](https://github.com/mattTea/takeaway-challenge/blob/master/problem/takeaway_class_diagram.jpg)
    - From here I was able to create a [sequence diagram](https://github.com/mattTea/takeaway-challenge/blob/master/problem/takeaway_sequence_diagram.jpg) to plan further interactions, focused on how each aspect of the program would delegate to others

### What feedback have you had?

#### Riya Dattani - cohort pair partner (during Oystercard challenge)

- Found the breaking down of each user story and problem into an object model table and example feature test (in irb) of how the program would work really useful in planning how we would step through the problem


#### Alex Chen - cohort pair partner (during Battle challenge)

- Methodical approach when we had problems and things didn't work as expected. You took things step by step to work through it, and focused only on the next step to be able to move forward.


#### Arthur Ashman - cohort pair partner (during Bookmark Manager challenge)

- Very methodical in approach, and great at pulling us back to focus on test-driving the solution.
