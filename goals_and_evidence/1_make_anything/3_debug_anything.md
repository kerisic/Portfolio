# I can make anything

## I can debug anything

### Reflect: What does it mean to be able to debug anything?

Bugs and unexpected or undesired program behaviour are an integral part of software development.

To be able to debug anything is to understand this, and to readily use a methodical process to identify the cause and remove the issue.

Safely debugging relies heavily on a strong TDD approach and good test coverage, as test failures and the visibility they give will support early diagnosis, and provide the safety net when amending the offending code to remove the issue.

### Plan: List evidence you aim to collect that would together show you have credibly achieved this goal

### Can you say this about yourself? 

Yes

### Reflect: How does each of the following examples of your best work show evidence of achieving this goal? (e.g. Diode projects, Github repos)

Debugging skills [practical](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/master/week-3/debugging_2)
- [Process used to debug examples in practical](https://github.com/mattTea/Portfolio/blob/master/notes/week_3_raw_notes.md#debugging-process-used-in-this-practical)

Examples of bugs I debugged in certain projects
- Example 1
  - Process of debugging the like/unlike functionality in Acebook (got visibility and tightened the loop in .erb file - saw where the infinite loop was generated - the form creation block, removed to see program running, and worked to redesign the method)

- Example...
  - Get feedback and note other debugging examples - missed one or two examples in makersBnB

### What feedback have you had?

#### Paul Martin - cohort pair partner

- _You conduct very methodical debugging to read irb errors (when running manual feature tests) to investigate feature file code to see what is actually happening_ (Boris Bikes challenge)


#### Alex Chen - cohort pair partner

- _Methodical approach when we had problems and things didn't work as expected. You took things step by step to work through it, and focused only on the next step to be able to move forward_ (Battle challenge)
