# I can make anything

## I can program fluently

### Reflect: What does it mean to be able to program fluently?

Tp program fluently is to understand the core concepts of a chosen technology without having to regularly research them. It is to be able to utilise common methods, capabilities and patterns within that technology, and to have the knowledge to quickly research more advanced concepts.

Being fluent is to be familiar with more than just the syntax of a language, but with the conventions and preferred structure of all the technologies you use within an application. You can visualise how you plan to write the code to solve a problem.

### Plan: List evidence you aim to collect that would together show you have credibly achieved this goal

My problem breakdown approach, which allows me to structure my thinking and plan the structure of a solution, allowing me to more fluently write the code to build it

### Can you say this about yourself? 

Yes

### Reflect: How does each of the following examples of your best work show evidence of achieving this goal? (e.g. Diode projects, Github repos)

My [problem breakdown approach](https://github.com/mattTea/Portfolio/blob/master/processes/problem_breakdown.md) allows me to structure my thinking, plan the structure of a solution, and think about the design and parts of the technologies I plan to use to solve that problem. This allows me to be more fluent when writing tests and building the solution, as I have done a lot of thinking in advance, and don't need to stop to take stock and determine the next steps so often.

### What feedback have you had?

#### Amy Jordan - cohort par partner (Thermostat challenge)

- You were confident navigating the code and the project, particularly as it was in a language brand new to us this week (JavaScript)
- You make considered choices about design, naming and structure of your code
- You are good at attempting new things in a language, and quickly able to research syntax and style if needed


#### Arthur Ashman - process workshop partner 

- You got into a good flow and were comfortable and really confident in test-driving the solution. You naturally talked through all aspects of what you were doing.
