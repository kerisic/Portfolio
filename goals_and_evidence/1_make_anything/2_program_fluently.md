# I can make anything

## I can program fluently

### Reflect: What does it mean to be able to program fluently?

Tp program fluently is to understand the core concepts of a chosen technology without having to regularly research them. It is to be able to utilise common methods, capabilities and patterns within that technology, and to have the knowledge to quickly research more advanced concepts.

Being fluent is to be familiar with more than just the syntax of a language, but with the conventions and preferred structure of all the technologies you use within an application. You can visualise how you plan to write the code to solve a problem.

### Plan: List evidence you aim to collect that would together show you have credibly achieved this goal

1. My problem breakdown approach, which allows me to structure my thinking and plan the structure of a solution, allowing me to more fluently write the code to build it
    - [Link to process](https://github.com/mattTea/Portfolio/blob/master/processes/problem_breakdown.md)

2. Screen recording of me using this process
    - [Link to screen recording](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MLUtaq2My1sc5P6h8VSzPWSAE1z97Bpw)

3. A Project example where I have displayed fluent programming
    - [Link to Chitter challenge](https://github.com/mattTea/Portfolio/blob/master/projects/chitter.md)

4. Feedback from pair partners, team members and process workshops

### Can you say this about yourself? 

Yes

### Reflect: How does each of the following examples show evidence of achieving this goal?

1. My [problem breakdown approach](https://github.com/mattTea/Portfolio/blob/master/processes/problem_breakdown.md) allows me to structure my thinking, plan the structure of a solution, and think about the design and parts of the technologies I plan to use to solve that problem. This allows me to be more fluent when writing tests and building the solution, as I have done a lot of thinking in advance, and don't need to stop to take stock and determine the next steps so often.

2. During the [Chitter challenge](https://github.com/mattTea/Portfolio/blob/master/projects/chitter.md) I used my increasingly fluent knowledge of Ruby to implement an object relational model (ORM) design pattern to wrap the data in each row of the database tables in instances of both [`Peep`](https://github.com/mattTea/chitter-challenge/blob/master/lib/peep.rb) and [`User`](https://github.com/mattTea/chitter-challenge/blob/master/lib/user.rb) classes so that each `peep` and each `user` could be accessed and used in the application.

3. During this [process review example](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MLUtaq2My1sc5P6h8VSzPWSAE1z97Bpw) I showed elements of fluent programming in the use of `.slice()` method. I knew what I wanted to achieve, and knew there was a JavaScript method for it, and simply needed to double check the docs for syntax. (Seen at 11:25 in the recording).

### What feedback have you had?

#### Amy Jordan - cohort par partner (Thermostat challenge)

- You were confident navigating the code and the project, particularly as it was in a language brand new to us this week (JavaScript)
- You make considered choices about design, naming and structure of your code
- You are good at attempting new things in a language, and quickly able to research syntax and style if needed


#### Arthur Ashman - process workshop partner 

- You got into a good flow and were comfortable and really confident in test-driving the solution. You naturally talked through all aspects of what you were doing.
